## Friday, November 10, 9:30-10:30am

Wrap up containerization project started by Samantha and Irvin (and Rogelio) this summer and submit paper on results

Work broadly across different neural network architectures or narrow focus to specific neural network architecture?

Advantages of starting with focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) 
+ William is already working on GNNs
+ GNNs are a focus at PNNL
+ GNNs are used for MLPerf-HPC Open Catalyst which is one of our benchmarks
+ GNNs are more challenging to analyze, have been analyzed less than CNNs, so results will have more impact

Share project materials on private github -- Shirley will set this up

Initial steps:
+ Tutorial on GNNs
+ Tutorial/examples of analytical modeling

Next meeting:
+ No meeting November 24 because of Thanksgiving holiday
+ So next meeting will be Friday, Dec. 1, 9:30-10:30am

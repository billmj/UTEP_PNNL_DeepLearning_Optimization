## Friday, November 10, 9:30-10:30am

Wrap up containerization project started by Samantha and Irvin (and Rogelio) this summer and submit paper on results

Shirley outlined project tasks (see timeline on p. 11 of the proposal narrative):
+ Evaluate performance of MLPerf-HPC benchmarks
+ Develop analytical models of different neural network models
+ Construct empirical models of benchmarks and compare with analytical model predictions
+ Measure communication performance of distributed deep learning using Score-P
+ Optimize coupled simulation-deep learning workflows with domain science collaborators
  
Work broadly across different neural network architectures or narrow focus to specific neural network architecture?

Advantages of starting with focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) 
+ William is already working on GNNs
+ GNNs are a focus at PNNL
+ GNNs are used for MLPerf-HPC Open Catalyst which is one of our benchmarks
+ GNNs are more challenging to analyze, have been analyzed less than CNNs, so results will have more impact

Share project materials on private github -- Shirley will set this up

Initial steps:
+ Tutorial on GNNs
+ Tutorial on/examples of analytical modeling

Next meeting:
+ No meeting November 24 because of Thanksgiving holiday
+ So next meeting will be Friday, Dec. 1, 9:30-10:30am
